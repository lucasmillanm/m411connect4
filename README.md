# Self evaluation

I started off quite lost to be honest, but with time I started to get somewhere. 
I'm glad that I was able to get to a point that works, I really did the bare minimum on this project, but I'm okay with it,
since this wasn't my best. 
That's why I'd give myself a 4.25.

# Connect Four Template

A start of a project implementing a variant of the game "Connect Four".

## Mission

1. Extend the existing code such that the GreedyPlayer works.
2. Implement a strong Opponent using MinMax/Negamax with fixed depth (like 10).
3. Implement a perfect Player and optimize it for speed.
